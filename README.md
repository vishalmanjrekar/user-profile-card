## Part 2: Modifications & Refinements

### Follow Button Interactivity

**Implementation:**
- Added click event listener  
- Toggle state management  
- Visual feedback through CSS classes

**Implementation:**
- Added location section with icon  
- Integrated Font Awesome for location icon  
- Styled to match the existing design language

### Hover Effect
**Prompt Used:**
> "Add a CSS hover effect so that the card's background color changes when hovered over."

**Implementation:**

### Conditional Logic for Own Profile
**Prompt Used:**
> "Explain how I can make the Follow button disabled and show 'Own Profile' instead of 'Follow' if a variable called `isOwnProfile` is true."

**Implementation Approach:**
```javascript
const isOwnProfile = true;
if (isOwnProfile) {
  followBtn.textContent = 'Own Profile';
  followBtn.disabled = true;
  followBtn.classList.add('disabled');
}
```
